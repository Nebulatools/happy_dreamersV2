**Responsive Adaptations (NO redesign):**
- **Existing Dashboard** - Apply responsive CSS to current dashboard layout for mobile screens
- **Current Sleep Tracking Interface** - Make existing quick event logging responsive with touch-friendly button sizing
- **Existing Family Management** - Adapt current family/child selection to mobile layout
- **Current Report Interface** - Make existing report viewing mobile-friendly
- **Existing Notification Settings** - Responsive adaptation of current settings panel

**No New Screens Required** - All existing functionality will be maintained with responsive CSS adaptations only.

### UI Consistency Requirements

**Visual Consistency:** All mobile responsive adaptations must use the existing color palette, typography scale, and component styling from the current shadcn/ui implementation to ensure brand continuity.

**Interaction Consistency:** Touch interactions will follow established patterns from the desktop interface while adapting to mobile conventions (swipe gestures, touch targets, mobile-specific feedback).

**Content Consistency:** Information hierarchy and data presentation will mirror desktop layouts while optimizing information density for mobile screen constraints.

**Accessibility Consistency:** Mobile interfaces will maintain the same accessibility standards as existing desktop components, ensuring WCAG compliance across all screen sizes.
