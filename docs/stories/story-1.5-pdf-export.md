# Story 1.5: PDF Export Functionality

## Status: Draft

## Story
As a parent or healthcare professional,
I want to export sleep data and reports as PDF files,
so that I can share information with other healthcare providers or maintain offline records.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can generate PDF exports of sleep data for selected date ranges
2. Exported PDFs include child information, sleep patterns, and plan adherence metrics
3. Healthcare professionals can export edited reports with their custom notes included
4. PDF exports maintain professional formatting suitable for medical documentation
5. Export functionality works on both mobile and desktop interfaces

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Existing data analysis and reporting calculations provide accurate information for PDF generation
- **IV2**: Current user permissions and child access controls properly restrict export capabilities
- **IV3**: PDF generation does not impact app performance or existing report viewing functionality

## Dev Notes
- Use libraries like jsPDF or Puppeteer for PDF generation
- Implement server-side generation for better performance
- Include charts and visualizations in PDFs
- Support different paper sizes (A4, Letter)

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Large dataset export (1+ year of data)
- [ ] Concurrent export requests
- [ ] PDF file size optimization
- [ ] Server resource usage
- [ ] CDN delivery speed
