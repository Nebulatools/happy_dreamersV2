# Story 1.4: Healthcare Professional Report Editing

## Status: Draft

## Story
As a healthcare professional supervising family sleep improvement,
I want to edit generated sleep reports to add custom insights and adjust recommendations,
so that I can provide personalized guidance based on my professional assessment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Generated PDF reports include editable text fields for professional notes and recommendations
2. Healthcare professionals can modify AI-generated insights while preserving original data
3. Edited reports maintain professional formatting and include edit tracking/timestamps
4. Original unedited reports remain accessible for comparison and audit purposes
5. Custom edits are saved per family and persist across report regenerations

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Existing report generation logic and data analysis algorithms continue functioning unchanged
- **IV2**: Original automated reporting remains available for families who don't require professional editing
- **IV3**: Report data accuracy and integrity are preserved while enabling professional customization

## Dev Notes
- Implement report versioning system
- Use rich text editor for professional notes
- Maintain audit trail for all edits
- Consider using draft.js or similar for editing
