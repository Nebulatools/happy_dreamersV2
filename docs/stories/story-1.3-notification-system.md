# Story 1.3: Sleep Schedule Notification System

## Status: Draft

## Story
As a parent following my child's sleep plan,
I want to receive timely notifications for bedtime and nap time based on my child's individual schedule,
so that I can maintain consistent sleep routines without constantly checking the app.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System sends push notifications 15 minutes before scheduled sleep times based on each child's plan
2. Parents can customize notification timing (5, 10, 15, 30 minutes before) per child
3. Notifications include child name and specific sleep activity (bedtime, nap time, routine step)
4. Users can enable/disable notifications per child and per activity type
5. Notification settings sync across all devices for the same user account

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Existing sleep plan data and timing calculations remain unchanged and drive notification scheduling
- **IV2**: Current plan modification workflows automatically update notification schedules
- **IV3**: App performance and responsiveness remain unaffected by background notification processing

## Dev Notes
- Implement using Web Push API for browser notifications
- Consider using service like OneSignal or Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Store notification preferences in user profile
- Use cron jobs or scheduled tasks for notification triggers

### Task 3: Notification Scheduling Engine
- [ ] Create cron job system for scheduled notifications
- [ ] Implement notification queue management
- [ ] Build schedule calculator based on sleep plans
- [ ] Handle timezone conversions for notifications
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed notifications

### Task 4: Notification API Endpoints
- [ ] Create POST /api/notifications/subscribe for device registration
- [ ] Create GET /api/notifications/preferences for fetching settings
- [ ] Create PUT /api/notifications/preferences for updating settings

- [ ] Add activity type toggles (bedtime, nap, routine)
- [ ] Create notification preview/test functionality

### Task 6: Notification Content and Formatting
- [ ] Design notification templates for different event types
- [ ] Implement multi-language notification support

### Task 7: Cross-Device Synchronization
- [ ] Implement device token management for multiple devices
- [ ] Sync notification preferences across devices
- [ ] Handle device token refresh and cleanup

### Task 8: Notification Analytics and Monitoring
- [ ] Track notification delivery rates
- [ ] Monitor user engagement with notifications
- [ ] Implement notification effectiveness metrics
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for notification monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for notification system failures

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Notification scheduling algorithm tests
- Timezone conversion tests
- Preference validation tests
- Queue management tests

### Integration Tests

- Cross-device notification handling

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] iOS Safari push notifications
- [ ] Android Chrome notifications
- [ ] Desktop browser notifications
- [ ] Notification permission flows
- [ ] Background notification delivery
